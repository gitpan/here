=head1 NAME

here - insert generated source here

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

this module replaces a call to C< use here LIST; > with the contents of
C< LIST > at compile time.  perl then compiles C< LIST > and the remaining code.
there is B<not> an implicit block around C< LIST >

an example is probably best:

    my $x;
    use here 'my $y';
    my $z;

is exactly equivalent to:

    my $x;
    my $y;
    my $z;

the important thing here is that C< $y > is still in scope, which would not be
the case with a runtime C< eval >:

    my $x;
    eval 'my $y';
    my $z; # $y is not in scope here!

=head1 EXPORT

this module does not export anything, and must always be invoked at compile time
as:

    use here LIST;

it is intended to be used with a transformation function to allow new syntactic
sugar:

    sub my_0 {map {"my \$$_ = 0"} @_}

    use here my_0 qw(x y z);

which results in perl compiling:

    my $x = 0; my $y = 0; my $z = 0;

note the inserted semicolons (between every element of C<LIST> and at the end).

you can utilize the C< here::install > mechanism to make the code even shorter:

    use here::install my_0 => sub {map {"my \$$_ = 0"} @_};

    use my_0 qw(x y z);

C< here::install > has dynamic lexical scope if L<B::Hooks::EndOfScope> is
available. otherwise it is global and you can call:

    no here::install 'my_0';

when you are done with the macro if you want to clean up.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head1 BUGS

code following a C< use here ...; > line must be placed on a new line if that
code needs to be in the scope of the C< use here >

    $first->()
    use here '$second->()'; # comments are fine
    $third->();

    $first->();
    use here '$third->()'; $second->(); # but this is out of order
    $fourth->();

    use here 'my $x = 1'; # $x not in scope
    # $x in scope

as far as i can tell, this is a limitation of perl /C< Filter::Util::Call > and
not of this module.  patches welcome if this is not the case.

please don't fear that i've mentioned that this module uses
L<Filter::Util::Call>, since this module filters naught.  all it does is insert
C< LIST > at the top of perl's queue of lines to compile.  the filter is removed
at the same time, never to be called again. so fear not a filter that filters
not not a filter be.

write C< use here::debug; > before a C< use here LIST; > line to carp the
contents of C< LIST > when it is inserted into the source.

please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-here at rt.cpan.org>, or
through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=here>. I will be notified, and
then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
